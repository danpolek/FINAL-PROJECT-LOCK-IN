                <h3>40+ Years of Automotive Excellence</h3>
                <p>Founded in 1980 by Daniel Aduayi, Daniel Auto Dealer began as a small family-owned business with a passion for quality vehicles. What started as a modest used car lot has grown into one of the most respected dealerships in the region.</p>
                <p>Our founder's vision was simple: treat every customer like family and never compromise on quality. These principles still guide us today as we continue to serve generations of satisfied customers.</p>
                <p>We specialize in luxury imports, high-performance vehicles, and premium SUVs, with each vehicle undergoing our rigorous 150-point inspection process before being offered to our clients.</p>
                <p>In our inventory you'll find high-class cars with extraordinary luxury. We offer vehicles to fit any family, whether it's a family of 3 or 6. We're proud to be an authorized dealer for multiple brands including Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porsche and many more.</p>
