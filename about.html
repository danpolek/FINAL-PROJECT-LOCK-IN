                <h3>The Daniel Auto Dealer Difference</h3>
                <p>Founded in 1980 by automotive visionary Daniel Richardson, Daniel Auto Dealer began as a small family-run dealership with a big dream: to redefine luxury car buying. What started as a modest operation with just five vehicles has grown into one of the most respected names in premium automotive retail, with showrooms across three states and an international clientele.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p>We believe that purchasing a luxury vehicle should be as exceptional as the vehicle itself. Our approach combines old-world hospitality with cutting-edge technology to create a seamless, personalized experience for every client. Unlike typical dealerships, we focus on building lifelong relationships rather than making one-time sales.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Inventory</h3>
                <p>Our carefully curated selection represents the pinnacle of automotive engineering and design. As an authorized dealer for over 15 luxury brands including Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porsche, Rolls-Royce, and Bentley, we maintain an inventory of 150-200 vehicles at any time. Each undergoes our rigorous 150-point certification process to ensure it meets our exacting standards.</p>
                
                <h3>Brand Partnerships</h3>
                <p>Our longstanding relationships with manufacturers give us access to exclusive models, limited editions, and custom configurations unavailable through most dealers. We're proud to be one of only 12 dealers nationwide with Ferrari's "Prestige" designation and Lamborghini's "Ad Personam" customization program.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Team</h3>
                <p>Our 45-person team includes factory-trained technicians, master detailers, and sales consultants with an average of 12 years industry experience. Many of our staff hold manufacturer certifications from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche, ensuring expert knowledge of every vehicle we sell.</p>
